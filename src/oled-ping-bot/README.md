# CoderDojo OLED IR Sensor Collision Avoidance Robot
This is the source code for a CoderDojo Robot that uses an IR sensor for the distance sensor and an OLED for a display.

## Distance sensor test
_01-sharp-ir-sensor-test
Test to see if the IR sensor is working.  Distance measurements will be displayed on the serial console.

## OLED Test
_02-oled-test
Test to see of the OLED is working.  It will display a counter that increments every second.

## Motor Test
_03-motor-test
Test to see if the motors are all connected correctly.  The test will do the following:
1. Right wheel forward
2. Right wheel reverse
3. Left wheel forward
4. Left wheel reverse

## LED Strip Test
_04-led-strip-test

## Mode Button Test
_05-button-test

## Potentiometer Test
_06-pot-test

## Speaker Test
_07-speaker-test

## Integration Tests
Basic collision avoidance
_08-integration-test
