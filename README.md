# Welcome to the CoderDojo Robot Documentation

Welcome to the CoderDojo Robot book!  This book allows CoderDojo mentors to teach the concepts of Computer Science using an open
low-cost $30 Arduino components.  Because this is an open system, students may create many variations of these robots.

## About This Book
This book was written by a group of CoderDojo mentors interested in teaching the fundamentals of
Computer Science and Physical Computing using fun $25 robots.  Our goal it to keep costs low enough
so each person can purchase their own robot.

## Hardware
Our hardware is based an Arduino Nano that can be purchased on-line for under $3.  
You will also need a chasis, a motor controller and two DC motors.  Our base Robot platform uses the low-cost L293D motor controller.

## Software
We use the standard Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which usese a variation of the C programming language.
We use this since software since it is by far the most popular language for teaching Arduino and basic robotics.

## Building Your Own Robot
This book also has a guide to help you build your own robot based on open standards and parts.
You can also find [detailed assembly instructions](https://www.instructables.com/id/Collision-Avoidance-Robot-for-Teaching-Programming/) on the 
Instructables web site.

## Instructors Guide
This book comes with a detailed [Instructors Guide](docs/instructors-guide.md) which is designed for teachers and mentors that 
are new to teaching computer science using robotics.
